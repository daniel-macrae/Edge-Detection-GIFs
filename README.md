## Creating Visualisations from Video Clips using Canny Edge Detection

MAIN.ipynb demonstrates the code behind the visualisation techniques, while UI.ipynb is a work in progress where I am creating a graphical user interface for users to enable/disable effects and adjust various parameters while seeing the results in real time.


Working features:
- Displays a mp4 file
- Adjusting the canny edge detection parameters
- adjusting frame-on-frame blur


Features to add:
- Change appearance mode button (light/dark)
- Video frame slider (across the bottom of the frame)
- Options panel (right side) **WIP**
- Video filepath (read)
- Exporting (+ filepath)
- Frame skip rate
- User-adjusted image size
- Refresh image after the parameters have been adjusted (without skipping to next frame)
